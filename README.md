# Retirement Calculator

This **Retirement Calculator** is a tool designed to help individuals estimate the amount of money they will need to save for retirement. The calculator determines the required retirement corpus and suggests how much needs to be saved each month to reach the desired corpus, based on a set of input variables like current expenses, age, retirement age, inflation rate, and rate of return.

## Features

- **Estimate Retirement Corpus**: Calculates the total amount needed for retirement based on monthly expenses, retirement age, life expectancy, inflation, and rate of return.
- **Monthly Savings Calculation**: Provides the monthly savings required to achieve the estimated retirement corpus by the time of retirement.
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Accounts for inflation to project future expenses.
- **Rate of Return**: Calculates based on a user-defined rate of return (post-tax) and real rate of return (monthly).

1. **Currently Monthly Expenses**: The current monthly living expenses.
2. **Current Age**: The age of the individual.
3. **Retirement Age**: The age at which the individual plans to retire.
4. **Life Expectancy**: The estimated age until which the individual expects to live.
5. **Rate of Inflation**: The expected annual inflation rate (as a percentage).
6. **Rate of Return (Post Tax)**: The expected annual rate of return on investments after taxes (as a percentage).
7. **Saving’s Interest Rate**: The interest rate earned on savings (as a percentage).
8. **Real Rate of Return (Monthly)**: The monthly rate of return considering inflation and actual investment growth.
